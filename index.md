### Finger Analogue 
#### Annulus Medical
#### Overview:
In order to validate the safety and performance of our ring removing device,
we designed a test apparatus to simulate a swelling finger. It was comprised
of three layers of urethanes compression molded together. The layers
simulated bone, flesh, and skin. Water was pumped into the flesh layer to
simulate blood, and a pressure source was used to induce swelling.

### 25 kV Circuit Replacement 
#### Nova Scotia Power
#### Overview:
A circuit breaker failed catastrophically, cutting off a hydro generating station
from the grid, costing the power company $18 000 per day in additional fuel
costs. I was assigned as the lead engineer to coordinate the replacement. I
had to work with field crews, contractors, suppliers and other engineering
departments to assess damage to surrounding equipment, rebuild failed
infrastructure, coordinate an environment cleanup, and deliver daily updates
to all stakeholders. The project was completed in several weeks.
